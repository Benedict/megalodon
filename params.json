{"name":"Megalodon","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"","google":"UA-33670586-1","body":"The goal of megalodon to provide a simple, repeatable, and extendable way to setup a modern php development environment on Mac OS X. It consists of a collection of [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew) formulas and [chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) recipies. It's pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nThis project is heavily influenced by [cider/cinderella](https://github.com/atmos/cinderella), which is aimed at providing an environment for ruby/python/node. Megalodon started as a fork of [smeagol](https://github.com/atmos/smeagol) (the chef bits of cinderella), but has since taken a different approach.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).\r\n\r\nInstall megalodon:\r\n\r\n    brew install https://raw.github.com/msonnabaum/megalodon/master/formulas/megalodon.rb\r\n\r\nRun megalodon:\r\n\r\n    megalodon install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\nMegalodon uses OSX's built in apache, so you can restart apache like so:\r\n\r\n    sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart\r\n\r\nEverything else that's installed with homebrew should have a plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents (OSX's equivalent to /etc/init.d), which can be managed with lunchy. It will soon be included in megalodon, but for now just do `gem install lunchy`.\r\n\r\nFor example, you'd restart mysql like so:\r\n\r\n    lunchy restart mysql\r\n\r\n### Managing virtual hosts\r\n\r\nYou will need to edit /etc/hosts as per usual; To add a new virtual host, add a new .json file in:\r\n\r\n    ~/.megalodon/data_bags/vhosts\r\n\r\nTo re-generate the apache confs after modifying/adding vhosts:\r\n\r\n    megalodon update_vhosts\r\n\r\nThen restart apache as above.\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n\r\nmysql default username is root, no password"}
